# APIs are getting larger, how do Overlays help?

They do help... a little.

---

### Before we begin

And in the interest of being polite...

---

# Overlays - tl;dr

They're YAML files that take an YAML document as input and produce a modifed document as output.

# This talk

- The _other_ people involved in APIs
   - Docs, DevOps and PMs
- **Overlays:** How they work
- Shower thoughts
  - APIs as Pets or Toys?
  - A tool or a standard?
  - Anti-patterns and pitfalls
  
---

# Level setting.

- Technically Overlays work with YAML, not APIs.
- OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/JSON Schema are all YAML(ish) based.
- API  = API Definition or Document. For this talk.
- API ~ OpenAPI (because its what I know).

# Overlays - An Example

```yaml
overlays: 1.0.0
info: 
  description: This adds an emoji to POST /pet
  version: 1.0.0
extends: https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
actions: 
- target: '$.paths."/pet".post'
  update:
    summary: Add a new pet to the store üêï!
```

---

# How do Overlays work?

- Target some parts of the document and mutate them.
- Layer in these changes together to form an Overlay document

![bg right:40%](./layers.svg)

---

# The parts of an Overlay document

1. Some boilerplate
2. Extend some (URL of an) API.
3. List of actions
	a). Each action: Target things and then mutate those things.

---

# Boilerplate

```yaml
overlays: 1.0.0
```

Next -> Info

---

# Boilerplate - Info

```yaml
overlays: 1.0.0
info: 
  description: This adds an emoji to POST /pet
  version: 1.0.0
```

Next -> Extends

---

# Extend some API

```yaml
overlays: 1.0.0
info: 
  description: This adds an emoji to POST /pet
  version: 1.0.0
extends: https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
```

Next -> Actions

---

# List of Actions

```yaml
overlays: 1.0.0
info: 
  description: This adds an emoji to POST /pet
  version: 1.0.0
extends: https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
actions: 
- # Your action...
```

Next -> Talking about Actions

---

# An action

A **Target** and a **Mutation**

```yaml
# Target
target: ...

# Mutations
update: ...
remove: ...
```

_JP: Let's look at targetting things_

---

# Targeting with JSONPath

- Gaining traction as the defacto standard for querying JSON/YAML. 
- Mostly because it's being standardized and because it aims to do one thing, target nodes.

![bg left](./bullseye.png)

---

<!-- _class: offset-img-64 -->

# JSONPath Examples

Examples: ![w:64](./bullseye.png)

- `$.paths."/pet".post'`  &mdash; One specific thing
- `$.paths.*.*.` &mdash; Wildcards
- `$.tags[?(@.name == "pet")]` &mdash; Filters/Expressions
- `$..description` &mdash; All decendants

---

# Mutating things 

- `update` merges in a value
- `remove` it uh... removes it.

```yaml
update: 
  summary: Add a new pet to the store üêï!
  description: Something descriptive
```

```yaml
remove: true
```

---

# Putting them together into an action

```yaml
target: '$.paths."/pet".post'
update:
  summary: Add a new pet to the store üêï!
```

---

# All together now!

```yaml
overlays: 1.0.0
info: 
  description: This adds an emoji to POST /pet
  version: 1.0.0
extends: https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
actions: 
- target: '$.paths."/pet".post'
  update:
    summary: Add a new pet to the store üêï!
```

<!-- _footer: Bowser and Blossom -->
# APIs as Pets vs Toys

![bg right](./my-dogs.jpg)

- Pet: Lovingly represent a single service, every detail? 
- Toy: Cater to consumers, showing only what is needed?

---

### API shape proliferation

- One API could have many API (definitions), depending on consumers.
- The more shapes there are, the more composition will matter.

---

# A tool or a standard?

TODO: 

Why make yet-another-standard (the 15th one!)?

- It starts with a tool
- A standard is meant to have many tools
- Overlays are meant to be in many places

TODO: Image of diagram and the real thing.

---

# Why Overlays 

As APIs become larger, as API-shape proliferation occurs more energy will be spent on composition and in more places.

A standard encourages adoption not just on the command line, but in different contexts.

---

# Anti-patterns and pitfalls

![bg left](./dodgy-step.png)

_Dodgy practices that can cause you to trip._

---

## Incomplete definitions

We can move a lot of stuff out of definitions and into Overlays.
Such as traits, groups of operations. 
This could leave you with an incomplete definition, that now _requires_ an Overlay.
Instead of enriching it becomes necessary and that limits adoption. 

---

# Traits in Overlays

---

### An incomplete OpenAPI definition

```yaml
# Requires the overlay to be valid, missing 'info'
openapi: 3.0.3
paths: {}
```

```yaml
overlays: 1.0.0
actions:
- target: '$'
  update:
    info:
      title: Why am I here?
      version: 1.0.0
```

This is now structural, not enriching.
TODO: Image of structure

---

## Semantic whack-a-mole

**JSONPath** is awesome, but it doesn't consider semantic of the underlying specifications.

It is possible to describe things in different places, but with the same meaning.

Consider parameters in OpenAPI.

---

### Parameters in OpenAPI

```yaml
paths:
 /foo:
   parameters:
   - name: bob

   get:
     parameters:
	 - name: frank
   post:
     parameters: []
```


`$.paths.*.parameters` vs `$.paths.*.*.parameters`

---

## Do you need Overlays?

Start with -> "No, I don't need Overlays.". 
Then ponder the following.

- Do you need variations of an API?
- Is the source inaccessable? Code annotations, traffic inference.
- Are there independent features of the API?
