# APIs are getting larger, how do Overlays help?

They help separate concerns.

---

### Before we begin

And in the interest of being polite...

---

# Overlays - tl;dr

They're YAML files that take a YAML document as input and produce a modifed document as output.

# This talk

- The _other_ people involved in APIs
   - Docs, DevOps and PMs
- **Overlays:** How they work
- Shower thoughts
  - APIs as Pets or Toys?
  - A tool or a standard?
  - Anti-patterns and pitfalls
  
---

# Level setting.

- Technically Overlays work with YAML, not APIs.
- OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/JSON Schema are all YAML(ish) based.
- I'll use the word API  to mean API Definition or Document, for this talk.
- If in doubt I'm usually referring to OpenAPI, not AsyncAPI/JSON Schema. Force of habit.

<!-- _class: middle -->

_The answer to everything_


---
# Overlays - An Example

```yaml
overlays: 1.0.0
info: 
  title: Add an emoji 
  version: 1.0.0
extends: https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
actions: 
- target: '$.paths."/pet".post'
  update:
    summary: Add a new pet to the store üêï!
```

---

# How do Overlays work?

- Target some parts of the document and mutate them.
- Layer in these changes together to form an Overlay document

![bg right:40%](./layers.svg)

---

# The parts of an Overlay document

1. Some boilerplate
2. Extend some (URL of an) API.
3. List of actions
	a). Each action: Target then mutate things.

---

# Boilerplate

```yaml
overlays: 1.0.0
```

Next ![w:32](./right.svg) Info

---

# Boilerplate - Info

```yaml
overlays: 1.0.0
info: 
  title: Add an emoji 
  version: 1.0.0
```

Next ![w:32](./right.svg) Extends

---

# Extend some API

```yaml
overlays: 1.0.0
info: 
  title: Add an emoji
  version: 1.0.0
extends: https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
```

Next ![w:32](./right.svg) Actions

---

# List of Actions

```yaml
overlays: 1.0.0
info: 
  title: Add an emoji
  version: 1.0.0
extends: https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
actions: 
- # Your action...
```

Next ![w:32](./right.svg) An Action

---

# An action

A **Target** and a **Mutation**

```yaml
# Target
target: ...

# Mutations
update: ...
remove: ...
```

_JP: Let's look at targetting things_

---

# Targeting with JSONPath

- Gaining traction as the defacto standard for querying JSON/YAML. 
- Mostly because it's being standardized and because it aims to do one thing, target nodes.

![bg left](./bullseye.png)

---

<!-- _class: offset-img-64 -->

# JSONPath Examples

Examples: ![w:64](./bullseye.png)

- `$.paths."/pet".post'`  &mdash; One specific thing
- `$.paths.*.*.` &mdash; Wildcards
- `$.tags[?(@.name == "pet")]` &mdash; Filters/Expressions
- `$..description` &mdash; All decendants

---

# Mutating things 

- `update` merges in a value
- `remove` it uh... removes it.

```yaml
update: 
  summary: Add a new pet to the store üêï!
  description: Something descriptive
```

```yaml
remove: true
```

---

# Putting them together into an action

```yaml
target: '$.paths."/pet".post'
update:
  summary: Add a new pet to the store üêï!
```

---

# All together now!

```yaml
overlays: 1.0.0
info: 
  title: Add an emoji
  version: 1.0.0
extends: https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
actions: 
- target: '$.paths."/pet".post'
  update:
    summary: Add a new pet to the store üêï!
```

---

# We can now Overlay

![](./tada.png)
- Patch files broadly or specifically
- Extract concerns 
- Handle (some) changes to the underlying APIs

# A tool or a standard?

Why make yet-another-standard (the 15th one!)?

- It starts with a tool
- A standard is meant to have many tools
- Overlays are meant to be in many places

![bg fit left:40%](./drawing-of-spanner.svg)

<!-- _footer: Bowser and Blossom -->
# Pets vs Toys

![bg right](./my-dogs.jpg)

**Pet:** Lovingly represent a single service, every detail? 

**Toy:** Cater to consumers, showing only what is needed? 

![](./dog.png)

---

### API shape proliferation

One API (service) could have many API (definitions), depending on consumers.

> **Assumption:** The more APIs, the more that composition and Overlays will be needed.

---

# Anti-patterns and pitfalls

![bg right](./dodgy-step.png)

_Dodgy practices that can cause you to trip._

---

## Invalid definitions

We can move a lot of stuff out of APIs and into Overlays.
Possibly leaving our APIs invalid.

---

### An invalid OpenAPI definition

```yaml
# Requires the overlay to be valid, missing 'info'
openapi: 3.0.3
paths: {}
```

```yaml
overlays: 1.0.0
actions:
- target: '$'
  update:
    info:
      title: Why am I here?
      version: 1.0.0
```

**Bad:** Limits the amount of tooling you can use.

---

# Incomplete APIs 

Using Overlays to describe necessary parts of the API.
This could leave you with an incomplete definition, that now _requires_ an Overlay.

Instead of enriching, it becomes structural.

Consider: **Traits for OpenAPI**
![bg right:40%](./duct-tape-tree.jpg)

---

## Semantic whack-a-mole

**JSONPath** is awesome, 
but it doesn't consider the semantics of the underlying specifications.

It is possible to miss targets using JSONPath. 

---

### Whack-a-parameter in OpenAPI

```yaml
paths:
 /foo:
   parameters:
   - name: bob

   get:
     parameters:
	 - name: frank
   post:
     parameters: []
```


1. `$.paths.*.*.parameters`  &mdash; usual
2. `$.paths.*.parameters` &mdash; not usually considered

---

## Do you need Overlays?

Start with, "No, I don't need Overlays."
&mdash; It is another moving part

Then ponder the following.

- Do you need variations of an API?
- Is the source inaccessable? Code annotations, traffic inference.
- Are there independent features of the API?
